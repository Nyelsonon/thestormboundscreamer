# thestormboundscreamer
i made a script that yells at you when you take damage in the game stormbound, although this works with all games if formatted correctly dont ask why im making this

anyways onto the important stuffs

## how it works
so what this does is use tesseract OCR to read the text  from a list of screenshots. The screenshots update at a fixed speed which can be altered for your needs. Anyways the program will notice if text changes and proceed to scream at you, however at the moment the code is not finsihed so the features wont work yet. Ill leave an update here when it is finished


## imports
before you run the file make sure to download the imports which currently are cv2, pytesseract, numpy, pyautogui, time. Don't worry its pretty to simple to dowload imports, just search up install whatever import you are importing i.e: install cv2 python, go to the first website. Copy the command and then paste it into command prompt or terminal this depends on your OS.

## files
before you run the scrip tmake a folder called ocr or smthg rly doesnt matter, then place the script in the folder. not that hard, also p.s if the script does not work keep an image named *"image1.png"*

## other RLY important stuffs
ight so the script takes a pic of a certain region on your screen so you will have to change the variables according to your screen. Ill find a solution to this later.

# THATS IT MY BOIS
now go get yelled at by your computer
